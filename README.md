# chatbotworkshop

* Anton will provide a 1-day (~6hrs + breaks) training workshop for IoT613.
* Topic will focus on developing a chatbot that can interface with a sensor system.
* Chatbot development will be on Watson Conversation.
* The sensor system will be in place to show direct correlation of chatbot AI usage in a IoT setting.
* Workshop to be provided for up to 20 people.
* Participants will leave with a GitHub repository of their own chatbot program.
* Since Anton will be away for all of August and early September, we will find an agreeable day to hold the workshop in late * * September, 2017 (mid-week, during business hours).
* Anton will help with marketing through IBM's social media accounts.
* Neither Anton, nor IBM will receive revenues, in whole or in part, from IoT613's ticket sales; it is understood that Anton/IBM are providing their time to IoT613 as an in-kind sponsorship.
* Anton will be capable of providing 2-3 workshops per year (topics TBD, but may include a repeat of the chatbot development, blockchain, tone analyzer/personality insights, etc.).
